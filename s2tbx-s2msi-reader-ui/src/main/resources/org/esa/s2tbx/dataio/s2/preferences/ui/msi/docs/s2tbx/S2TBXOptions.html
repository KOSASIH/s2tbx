    It is possible to configure the Sentinel-2 Cache and to select if to load or not the different S2 masks.
</p>

<h4>Sentinel-2 Cache</h4>

<p><br>The S2 images are originally in JP2 format. These images are decompresed (by tiles) to new GeoTiff images internally in SNAP.
     These GeoTiff images are stored in [userFolder]/.snap/var/cache/s2tbx in order to be available in the future when working with the same images.
     The user can select in the S2TBX options interface when to delete the cache and also there is a button to clean up the cache.
</p>


<h4>Sentinel-2 Reader Masks</h4>

<p><br>
The Sentinel-2 products contain different kind of masks in GML format. By default, all the masks are loaded
     but the user can select to ignore some of them in order to be able to open the products faster.
