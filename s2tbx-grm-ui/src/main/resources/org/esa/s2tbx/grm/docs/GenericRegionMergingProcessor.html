<p>
    The Generic Region Merging Processor allows the segmentation of images of arbitrary size. The algorithm is similar with the algorithm from the Orfeo ToolBox.
</p>
<p>
    The memory required to process the images may be very high and therefore leads to unfeasibility on commonly available computers.
    The selected source bands to extract the segments must have the same resolution.
</p>
<p>
    The region-merging algorithms starts by assigning a different segment to each pixel of the image. The algorithm consists of merging adjacent segments until a
    criterion is fullfilled. At each iteration, merging costs are computed between adjacent segments.
</p>
<p>
    A segment and its best adjacent segment are merged, if their merging cost is smaller than a threshold. This threshold avoids undersegmentation.
    The merging process stops when there are no more posible fusions of segments. The number of segments may be different for each merging cost criterion.
</p>
<p>
    The types to compute the merging cost are: Spring, Baatz & Schape, Full Lamda Schedule and the criterion to merge two adjacent segments are: Best Fitting, Local Mutual Best Fitting.
