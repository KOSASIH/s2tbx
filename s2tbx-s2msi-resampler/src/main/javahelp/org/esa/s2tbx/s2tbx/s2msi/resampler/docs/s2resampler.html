<p>
    This option allows to resample Sentinel-2 products having into account
    the particularities of the angle bands.
</p>
<p>
    Because of the discontinuity of the angles when the detector changes,
    the result of the resampling of the azimuth angle bands is not good from the
    physics point of view, since it blurs the border between detectors when we use
    a bilinear method. It is needed an specific processor to carry out the resampling
    of these bands in a ?special? way.

    This operator uses not only the angles bands but also the detector footprints.
    By using the footprints, it is possible to ?isolate? the angles of each detector and
    interpolate them without using the angle information of the adjacent detectors (which causes
    the blurring). In the pixels closest to the border detector-detector, it is necessary to
    extrapolate the data since not all data is available to carry out the interpolation with
    bilinear method. Finally, the angles are joined again:
